rcHex is a radio-controlled hexapod with 18 degrees of freedom, capable 
of positional and rotational body adjustment as well as omnidirectional 
travel at variable speeds using three common gaits. This project 
explores some of the design intricacies of hexapod movement, including 
gait sequencing and the application of inverse kinematics to 
multi-jointed limbs.
